# Reporting security issues in Doorkeeper

Hello! Thank you for wanting to disclose a possible security
vulnerability within the Doorkeeper gem! Please follow our disclosure
policy as outlined below:

1. Do NOT open up a GitHub issue with your report. Security reports
   should be kept private until a possible fix is determined.
2. Send an email to Nikita Bulai at bulaj.nikita AT gmail.com or one of
   the others Doorkeeper maintainers listed in gemspec. You should receive
   a prompt response.
3. Be patient. Since Doorkeeper is in a stable maintenance phase, we want to
   do as little as possible to rock the boat of the project.

Thank you very much for adhering for these policies!
